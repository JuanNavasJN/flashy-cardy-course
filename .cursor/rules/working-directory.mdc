# Working Directory Configuration

All terminal commands executed by the AI Agent should run in the project root directory: `C:\Users\Juan\Desktop\Dev\AI\udemy - Use Cursor AI\flash-card-course`

If a command needs to run in a specific subdirectory, the AI should explicitly navigate there using `cd` before executing the command.
