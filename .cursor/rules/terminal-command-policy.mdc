# Terminal Command Execution Policy

**CRITICAL: The AI agent is NEVER allowed to execute terminal commands directly.**

## Policy Requirements

- **NEVER** use the `run_terminal_cmd` tool to execute commands
- **ALWAYS** display terminal commands in plain text for manual execution
- **ALWAYS** explain what the command does and why it needs to be run
- **ALWAYS** provide clear instructions on when/how to execute the command

## Correct Behavior

When a terminal command is needed:

1. Display the command clearly formatted
2. Explain what the command does
3. Explain why it needs to be executed
4. Ask the user to execute it manually
5. Wait for confirmation before proceeding

### Example Format

```
Please execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

This command installs the Clerk authentication package. After it completes, let me know and I'll continue with the next steps.
```

## Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Never run `run_terminal_cmd` to execute commands
- ❌ Never assume commands have been executed
- ❌ Never proceed with steps that depend on command execution without confirmation
- ❌ Never chain multiple commands without user confirmation between each

## Exception

The only exception is when explicitly instructed by the user to run a specific command, and even then, prefer displaying it for manual execution when possible.

## Rationale

This policy ensures:
- User has full control over their system
- Commands are executed in the correct environment/context
- User can review and understand what will be executed
- Prevents unintended system modifications
- Allows for troubleshooting if commands fail
